The script reads a list of names from the file *"employees.xlsx"* to show them into the list-box for easy selection. Manual entry is also supported. Both selected as well as manually entered names will be written to the file *"registered.xlsx"* with the date/time of entry. Both Excel files need be stored in the current working directory. 

Additional input parameters (in the script is is the number of masks taken) can be easily customized in the custom dialog *ExtraDataDialog*, called from *run_extra_data_dialog*.
